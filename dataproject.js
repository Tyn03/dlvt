      Hi Everyone, I am DO Uy Khang from VietNam. I am currently a student at 4th INSA Centre Val de Loire, Bourges, Cher, France.
  
    My actual study field is software engineering and Cyber Security Information. 
    I have a passion for building innovative software solutions that make an impact. 
    With a strong foundation in algorithms and a solid understanding of Java and C, 
    I have honed my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) within Java. When I am not coding,
     you can find me exploring new technologies, reading books, or playing video games. 
     Along both university and personal projects, I have picked up a range of skillsâ€”using Node.js,
      React, Next.js for development, Docker for deployment, and even getting a taste of cybersecurity.

        <p > Loukas NGUYEN 
        I developed a simple e-commerce website that allows users to buy and sell products online. The website includes the following basic features:</p>
        <ul style="color: #8b949e;">
          <li><b>Product Listing Page:</b> Displays a list of products with images, prices, and detailed descriptions.</li>
          <li><b>Shopping Cart:</b> Allows users to add, modify, or remove products from the cart.</li>
          <li><b>Checkout Process:</b> Integrates a simple checkout flow for completing orders.</li>
          <li><b>Product Management Page (for sellers):</b> Enables sellers to add, edit, or delete products.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: #58a6ff;">Tech Stack & Learnings</h3>
        <ul style="color: #8b949e;">
          <li><b>Backend:</b> Worked with Node.js for building APIs.</li>
          <li><b>Frontend:</b> React.js for dynamic UI, using component-based architecture.</li>
          <li><b>Communication:</b> APIs for connecting backend and frontend.</li>
        </ul>
        <p >The project taught me the importance of modularity, as each feature had its own structure (e.g., controllers, models, etc.).</p>
