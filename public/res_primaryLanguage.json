      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone, I am DO Uy Khang from VietNam. I am currently student at 4th INSA Centre Val de Loire, Bourges, Cher, France.\n\nMy actual study field is software engineering and Cyber Security Information. I have a passion for building innovative software solutions that make an impact. With a strong foundation in algorithms and a solid understanding of Java and C, I have honed my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) within Java. When I am not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading books, or playing video games. Along both university and personal projects, I have picked up a range of skillsâ€”using Node.js, React, Next.js for development, Docker for deployment, and even getting a taste of cybersecurity.",

          "description": "The short run\n\nI developed a simple e-commerce website that allows users to buy and sell products online. The website includes the following basic features:\n\n- **Product Listing Page**: Displays a list of products with images, prices, and detailed descriptions.\n- **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add, modify, or remove products from the cart.\n- **Checkout Process**: Integrates a simple checkout flow for completing orders.\n- **Product Management Page (for sellers)**: Enables sellers to add, edit, or delete products.\n\n### Tech Stack & Learnings\n\n- **Backend**: Worked with Node.js for building APIs.\n- **Frontend**: React.js for dynamic UI, using component-based architecture.\n- **Communication**: APIs for connecting backend and frontend.\n\nThe project taught me the importance of modularity, as each feature had its own structure (e.g., controllers, models, etc.).",
